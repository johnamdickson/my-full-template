Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

In this tutorial, I learnt the basics of CLI, Git and Github. A central pillar of the concept is the moving van analogy. The code and files are packed into boxes in the Gitpod workspace. 

The next stage is adding them to the staging area using "git add". These can be removed from the staging area by using the code "git rm filename". This is like packing the boxes and leaving them in the hall for removals company.

 Once happy with code and files, "git commit" command can be ran appending with "-m "meaningful message about the commit. Changes, additions etc." Here is an example in its entirety: "git commit -m "Rename stream-one to index and updated links". Going back to the analogy, the moving van company have loaded van with boxes.

The final stage is "git push" which moves the files into Github repository, which is like a secure storage space for our boxes.
